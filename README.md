**Movida // YouView Metadata Exporter // Summary of New Client Requirements**

**Purpose:** This repo contains an issue created for the (hypothetical) expansion of the Movida YouView Metadata Exporter for Len's interview with BeBanjo. The purpose of this issue is to summarize the client's requirements for the dev team and denote which new features need to be implemented in order to satisfy client requirements.

There is also a project Kanban with the issue assigned to the proper phase/column.

Please contact Len Forgione with any questions or requests for clarification: @lenforge or lenforgione@gmail.com.
