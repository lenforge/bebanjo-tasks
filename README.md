# bebanjo-tasks
Repo for bebanjo tasks

This repo contains issues created for the (hypothetical) expansion of the Movida YouView Metadata Exporter for Len's interview with BeBanjo.

The purpose of these issues is to summarize the client's requirements for the dev team and denote which new features need to be implemented to satisfy client requirements.

Please contact Len Forgione (lenforgione@gmail.com) with any questions or requests for clarification.
